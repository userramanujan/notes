what is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence-over the Internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale

Benifits of cloud-
• Faster time to market
• Scalability and flexibility
• Cost savings
• Better collaboration
• Advanced security
• Data loss prevention

Disadvantages of cloud-
• risk of vendor lock-in
• less control over underlying cloud infrastructure
• concerns about security risks like data privacy and online threats
• integration complexity with existing systems
• unforeseen costs and unexpected expenses

Types of clouds- Public cloud , Private cloud and Hybrid cloud

Public Cloud-
• Hosted at Service provider Site.
• Supports connectivity over intemet
• Suitable for information not very sensitive
• Cheaper than private cloud
• Utitzes shared infrastructure
• Supports multiple customers
• Requires nigher level of secunty
• Shared servers
• No Dedicated proactive monitoring
• Fixed-cost
• Multitenant architecture

Private Cloud-
• Hosted at Enterprise or Service provider Site
• Supports connectivity over Internet Private network (WAN)
• Suitable for very sensitive information
• Costier than public cloud
• Doesn't utilize shared infrastructure
• Supports one customer
• Requines medium level of security
• Dedicated servers
• Dedicated proactive monitoring
• Dedicated customer architecture

Hybrid cloud-
• combination of both public and private cloud
• shared security responsibilities
• helps maintain higher controls over sensitive data and processes

Cloud service modals-
• Iaas
• Paas
• Saas

Amazon Web Services-
Amazon Web Services(AWS) is the world's most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally.

Computer services-
• Elastic Computer Cloud-EC2
• ECS/EKS-Containerized Services

• Globally unique bucket names

EC2-
• Most Popular AWS offering
• Infrastructure as a code service
• Provides rented Virtual Machines
• EC2 uses EBS and instance store to store data
• EC2 uses ELB to distribute data
• EC2 uses autoscaling for scaling purpose
• Bootstrapping can be done using userdata scripts
